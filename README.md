xblock-carouselworkspace
=============
This is our second XBlock to combine learning content and practice space within the same window. The first XBlock provided a multimedia carousel to host learning contents [here](https://github.com/METIT-BU/xblock-carousel "Carousel XBlock github"). This XBlock along with providing a multimedia carousel, focuses on embedding a separate url of a web-enabled workspace for hands-on activities. In the example below, we demonstrate this XBlock with terminal emulator using open source [Gateone](https://github.com/liftoff/GateOne "GateOne") application.

TO-DO: 
-	Replace iframe with js embedding for the gateone example
-	Replace the login with single sign on authentication for the gateone example
-	Add additonal parameters for workspace configuration
